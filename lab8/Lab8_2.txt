a. i_ each of the variables is a component.  This matters because then these functional applications can be re-used and can be thought about in isolation.
   ii_ JSX transforms XML-like syntax in React to javascript
   iii_ The comments are loaded from the URL on component did mount, new comments are added by setting the state of author and text, and the comments are saved using the handleCommentSubmit which refreshes the server
   iv_ Props are immutable, they are "owned" by the parent.  State is mutable and can be changed using this.setState().  The distinction matters because if we want to be able to set a variable in the child, we must use state instead of props.

b. i_The page is automatically updated to reflect the changes since the interval is 2000
ii_ The components are already visible on the page, so when setting the state are simply updating the values of the components
iii_ So that the state of the DOM does not differ from the state of the component
iv_ Currently we are simply using Date.now() for our optimisitc id, which would require a more robust system in the future since 2 people could post at same time.  If the server rejects the comment, we pass all the comments in as the data and do not print out the new comment

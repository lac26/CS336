a)
I could only test the get and the .all(requests) with the browser but could test all of the methods with the curl tool.  The post,put,header etc. requests I could not test in chrome because they had the same address '/request' as get and get is the request called by defualt.
The requests I tested were:
curl -X PUT http://localhost:2000/request -d {"person":"Lydia"} -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
curl -X GET http://localhost:2000/request -d {"person":"Lydia"} -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
curl -X HEAD  http://localhost:2000/request -d {"person":"Lydia"} -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
curl -X POST  http://localhost:2000/request -d {"person":"Lydia"} -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
curl --head http://localhost:2000/request  
curl http://localhost:2000/request
b) Either page not found(404) or BAD_REQUEST

a) Forms support the post method, which reads in the current content of the form.  They also suppport get in order to display the form on the webpage.
b) The form data is received from the html and passed back to the server via a body object populated with the data via the post method.  The data itself is not modified but the format it is displayed in is modified.
